# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been replaced by security-scanning.yml
#
# The OSSAR workflow was Windows-only and has been superseded by a more
# comprehensive cross-platform security scanning workflow that uses
# microsoft/security-devops-action.
#
# New security scanning workflow:
# - Runs on Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu latest, and Windows latest
# - Uses microsoft/security-devops-action (more current than OSSAR)
# - Supports both Linux and Windows platforms
# - Includes feature branch testing (claude/**)
# - Provides manual workflow_dispatch triggers
#
# See: .github/workflows/security-scanning.yml
#
# This file is kept for historical reference only.
# To enable the new workflow, see security-scanning.yml
