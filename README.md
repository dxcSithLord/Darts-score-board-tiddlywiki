With help from Claude.ai:

I'll create a darts competition scoreboard using TiddlyWiki's HTML format. 

This will be a self-contained TiddlyWiki file with interactive scoring functionality for a darts tournament.I've created a comprehensive darts competition scoreboard in TiddlyWiki format! This scoreboard includes:

## Key Features:

**Tournament Management:**
- Add/remove players dynamically
- Support for different game types (501, 301, Cricket)
- Player statistics tracking (games won, average score, best finish)

**Live Scoring:**
- Real-time score updates
- Current player indicator
- Undo functionality for mistakes
- Bust detection for standard games

**TiddlyWiki Styling:**
- Authentic TiddlyWiki look and feel with tiddlers
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Clean, professional tournament interface

**Advanced Features:**
- Match history log with timestamps
- Automatic winner detection
- Player statistics calculation
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to record score)

## How to Use:

1. **Add Players**: Enter player names and click "Add Player"
2. **Start Game**: Select game type (501/301/Cricket) and click "Start New Game"
3. **Record Scores**: Enter the score thrown and press Enter or click "Record Score"
4. **Track Progress**: Watch the live scoreboard update with current scores and statistics

The scoreboard automatically handles turn rotation, win detection, and maintains a complete history of the tournament. It's perfect for pub leagues, tournaments, or casual games with friends!

# Version 2

Perfect! I've updated the darts scoreboard with both requested features:

## New Game Type Added:
**180 Game** - A shorter, faster game format where players start with 180 points instead of 501 or 301. This allows for quicker matches and different strategic approaches.

## Mobile & Tablet Responsive Design:
The scoreboard now includes comprehensive responsive design for all screen sizes:

### Mobile Phones (Portrait & Landscape):
- Optimized button sizes and touch targets
- Stacked form controls for easier input
- Compressed scoreboard with readable font sizes
- Full-width buttons for easy tapping

### Tablets:
- Balanced layout that works in both orientations
- Appropriately sized text and controls
- Flexible grid system for the scoreboard

### Small Screen Landscape:
- Compact header to maximize content space
- Reduced margins and padding
- Optimized control layout
- Shorter match history panel

### Key Responsive Features:
- **Flexible scoreboard** that adapts to screen width
- **Touch-friendly controls** with larger tap targets
- **Readable text** at all screen sizes
- **Efficient use of space** in landscape mode
- **Scrollable content areas** where needed

The 180 Game follows the same rules as 501/301 but with a lower starting score, making it perfect for quick tournament rounds or when time is limited. Players still need to finish on exactly 0 (no bust on score of 1 unlike other formats).

The responsive design ensures the scoreboard works perfectly whether you're using it on a phone during a pub game, a tablet at a tournament, or switching between portrait and landscape orientations!
