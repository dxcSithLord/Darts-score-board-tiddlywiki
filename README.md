With help from Claude.ai:

I'll create a darts competition scoreboard using TiddlyWiki's HTML format. 

This will be a self-contained TiddlyWiki file with interactive scoring functionality for a darts tournament.I've created a comprehensive darts competition scoreboard in TiddlyWiki format! This scoreboard includes:

## Key Features:

**Tournament Management:**
- Add/remove players dynamically
- Support for different game types (501, 301, Cricket)
- Player statistics tracking (games won, average score, best finish)

**Live Scoring:**
- Real-time score updates
- Current player indicator
- Undo functionality for mistakes
- Bust detection for standard games

**TiddlyWiki Styling:**
- Authentic TiddlyWiki look and feel with tiddlers
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Clean, professional tournament interface

**Advanced Features:**
- Match history log with timestamps
- Automatic winner detection
- Player statistics calculation
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to record score)

## How to Use:

1. **Add Players**: Enter player names and click "Add Player"
2. **Start Game**: Select game type (501/301/Cricket) and click "Start New Game"
3. **Record Scores**: Enter the score thrown and press Enter or click "Record Score"
4. **Track Progress**: Watch the live scoreboard update with current scores and statistics

The scoreboard automatically handles turn rotation, win detection, and maintains a complete history of the tournament. It's perfect for pub leagues, tournaments, or casual games with friends!
